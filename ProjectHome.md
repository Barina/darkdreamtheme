A Dark Dream theme for CyanogenMod builds that people can download from the CMUpdater 4.0 app


in the very beginning that wasn't my theme.. it was the HTC Dark Hero theme from Armyranger251 and Beagz that i take it and change a little things for my self..
then i was starting to change a lots of things and decided to let people see and judge and suggest other things.. then people asked me if i can change things for them too in that theme and i agreed and soon it became my theme DarkDream theme and i became a themer.. in these days im working on that theme to upgrade it and make it the most awesome theme for Cyanogen's builds.
without your help nothing was done right here.. so thank you all for all your help. :)
Barina.
